# Twenty Fourty All

Game jam theme: Alone against all

## Game idea:

A 2048 game where you can only move one tile. This tile can push tiles
if there's room to move/merge, or pull a tile towards it. 
The goal is, as always, 2048.

A seal gyu-ing or neck extending

Arrow keys/wasd to move, click/right click to push

### Old ideas

2048 tower defense, merge tiles to get better towers (not one or all enough)

## Parts

### Grid

Is: 5x5 (6x6?) grid that the player moves around on

### Yo-chan (player), main tile

Is: The player, the "main tile"

Can:
 - Move around the grid one space at a time (WASD/Arrows/HJKL)
 - Pull an ice block towards her with a gyu (clicking)
 - Push an ice block away from her with a nobite (right clicking)

### Ice block

Is: The main "tile"

Can: 
 - Slide around the grid in the direction it's moving
 - When it hits a block of the same number, it merges into it

### Tsuki-chan

Is: An "enemy" in the game

Can:
 - Steal and a tile on the edge of the board.

### Trainer

Can:
 - Throw fish onto the grid

### Marine mammal rescue shoutout
